# Blocker

As an aspiring programmer, after going through many online courses and tutorials,
I sought the rigor and project-based structure that college courses provide. I was fortunate
enough to come across CS61B - Data Structures, taught by Josh Hug at U.C. Berkeley.

Blocker is a game in which the player must avoid being caught by enemy ghosts and reach a portal
to make it to the next level of the game. More ghosts spawn as the level increases.
Each level, the player gains two special moves - the ability to create or destroy a wall.
The game ends when the player is caught by a ghost.

# Project Specifications:
https://sp18.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2/proj2.

The purpose of the project is to create an engine for explorable worlds. It is meant to emulate
a typical software-engineering project, as there is little to no starter code. 

The code can be found in the "Core" folder. With the exception of the randomUtils class, 
every class was programmed from scratch by me.
